      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a real estate photographer who understands what actually makes a listing perform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before picking up the camera, I spent years working in real estate, so I don’t just shoot pretty rooms, I shoot marketing assets designed to get more clicks, more showings, and better offers. Every image is composed with MLS, Zillow, and social media in mind: clean verticals, accurate color, and angles that highlight what buyers care about most.
      </p>
      <p>
        My focus is simple: help agents present homes at their absolute best. From bright, balanced interior photos to curb-appeal exteriors, FAA-compliant drone work, and vertical video reels for social, I deliver media that’s ready to use across every platform agents rely on.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m based in Florida and work with agents, brokers, and teams who want consistent quality, fast turnaround, and visuals that actually support their marketing, not just fill a gallery.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re looking for a photographer who thinks like a marketer and shoots like a professional, you’re in the right place.

    <section class="about mission" id="mission">
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        At Elevate Real Estate Photography, our mission is to help agents and brokers market properties more effectively through visuals that are built to perform, not just look good.
      </p>
      <p>
        We create MLS-ready photography, aerials, and video content designed to drive attention, increase engagement, and support faster, stronger listings. Every shoot is approached with a marketer's mindset and a photographer's eye, focusing on clean composition, accurate color, and images that showcase what buyers care about most.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because we come from the real estate world, we understand that great photography isn't art for art's sake, it's a business tool. Our goal is simple: deliver consistent, high-quality media that makes your listings stand out, strengthens your brand, and helps you win more business.
